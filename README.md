# Omarchy Mac — Dual Boot Installation

A concise, beginner-friendly guide to install Omarchy Mac (Asahi Alarm + Omarchy) alongside macOS on Apple Silicon (M1/M2).

> **Continuation fork.** The original [`malik-na/omarchy-mac`](https://github.com/malik-na/omarchy-mac) was deleted along with its maintainer's GitHub account in mid‑2026. This repository preserves the most complete known snapshot of that work and is being kept in sync with upstream [`basecamp/omarchy`](https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy). It is not officially affiliated with the original project.

_This project is not optimized for Parallels or VMs._

## Before you begin

Ensure the following before starting:

- A recent backup of macOS (Time Machine or similar).
- An Apple Silicon Mac (M1/M2 family). Verify compatibility: https://asahilinux.org/fedora/#device-support
- At least 50 GB free on the internal SSD (100 GB recommended).
- Internet access.

Checklist

- [ ] Backup completed
- [ ] Sufficient disk space
- [ ] Internet connected

## Quick start

Run the Asahi Alarm installer from macOS Terminal and follow the UI.

```bash
curl https://asahi-alarm.org/installer-bootstrap.sh | sh
```

Select `Asahi Arch Minimal`. When the installer finishes and you boot into Arch, continue with the detailed instructions below.

---

## Detailed installation

Follow these steps after the installer has finished and you have booted into the new Arch system.

### Run Asahi Alarm

- From macOS Terminal run the quick start command above.
- In the installer choose `Asahi Arch Minimal` and allocate at least 50 GB for Linux.

### Initial Arch setup

Run these commands (replace placeholders where indicated):

```bash

#Login as root with username and password 'root'

# Configure Wi‑Fi (if required)
nmtui

# Update packages
pacman -Syu

# Install essential packages
pacman -S --needed git base-devel chromium # nvim, btop, etc.
```

Notes

- If `nmtui` shows an error after activation, reboot and try again.
- Use `--needed` to avoid reinstalling packages that already exist.

### Enable the UTF-8 locale

Edit `/etc/locale.gen`:

```bash
nano /etc/locale.gen # nano, nvim (if installed before), vi, or any other text editor
```

In the opened configuration file scroll and uncomment the en_US line, like this:

```bash
...
#en_SG_SG.UTF-8 UTF-8
#en_SG ISO-8859-1
en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8
#en_US ISO-8859-1
#en_ZA.UTF-8 UTF-8
...
```

Save the edited file and proceed to enable UTF-8:

```bash
# To generate new locale.conf
locale-gen

# To apply changes
reboot

locale # Must be UTF-8
```

### Create a regular user

Create a non‑root user and enable sudo for the wheel group:

```bash
# Replace <username> with your chosen name
useradd -m -G wheel <username>
passwd <username>

# Enable wheel in sudoers
EDITOR=nano visudo
# Uncomment: %wheel ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

# Switch to your user
su - <username>
```

Unattended installs: you may use `NOPASSWD:` for wheel, but this reduces security.

### Install yay and Omarchy Mac

As the non‑root user:

```bash
# Install yay (AUR helper)
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
cd yay
makepkg -si

# Clone and run Omarchy Mac installer
git clone https://github.com/scottjones/omarchy-mac.git ~/.local/share/omarchy
cd ~/.local/share/omarchy
bash install.sh
```

- Enter your password when prompted and follow the installer's prompts.
- If mirrors fail, run `bash fix-mirrors.sh` from the repository root and retry.

---

## Post-install tasks

- Reboot and select the Linux entry.
- Verify display, keyboard, touchpad, Wi‑Fi, and external monitor support.

---

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

### I lost network during install

1. Try the interactive UI: `nmtui`.
2. If that fails, use NetworkManager CLI:

```bash
nmcli device status
nmcli device wifi list ifname wlan0
nmcli device wifi connect "SSID_NAME" password "PASSWORD" ifname wlan0
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
sudo journalctl -u NetworkManager -b
```

Replace `wlan0` with your wireless device name. Inspect `sudo journalctl -u NetworkManager -b` and `/var/log/pacman.log` for clues.

### Mirrors are slow or failing

1. Run the helper: `bash fix-mirrors.sh` and retry.
2. Manually edit `/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist` if needed:

```bash
sudo cp /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.bak
sudo nano /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
# move mirrors from your country to the top
```

3. If regional mirrors are unreliable, use a US fallback (move to top):

```
Server = https://mirrors.kernel.org/archlinux/$repo/os/$arch
```

4. Refresh and update:

```bash
sudo pacman -Syyu
```

Choosing a US mirror is a practical fallback when local mirrors are unreliable.

## Removal (uninstall)

There is no automatic uninstaller. Manual removal requires reversing the install steps. If you need help, open an issue.
